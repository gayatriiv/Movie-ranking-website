                <h3>Eternal sunshine of spotless mind</h3>
                <p>One of the great movies I’ve ever seen. The way it beautifully intertwined love and science fiction was simply magical. The editing, smoothly transitioning from new to old memories, was masterfully done. The score added a profound layer and Jim Carrey’s serious performance was exceptional. What strikes me is, despite its incredible qualities, why isn’t this film more popular?</p>

                <h3>Me Before You</h3>
                <p> It’s an emotional tearjerker with plenty of laughs and palpable chemistry between the two leads!</p>
